## 🔴 LEVEL 1: THE GLITCH
**STATUS:** `CRITICAL` | **ENEMY:** `PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE`

We face a massive bug in the system. **Windows 10 support is ending**, and schools/institutions are about to throw away perfectly good hardware. This linear cycle of consumption is expensive, wasteful, and scientifically unsustainable.

The **"NIRD"** (numérique inclusif, responsable et durable) must be stopped.

## 🟢 LEVEL 2: THE PATCH
**MISSION:** Turn schools into digital fortresses.

**Resistech** is an interactive web platform designed to diagnose and upgrade aging hardware. We don't just complain about the problem; we provide the source code to fix it.
